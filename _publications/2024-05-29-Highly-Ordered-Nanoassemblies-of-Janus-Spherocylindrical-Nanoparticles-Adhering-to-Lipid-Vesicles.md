excerpt: 'The lipid membrane-mediated self-assembly of NPs, demonstrated by this work, provides an alternative cost-effective route for fabricating highly engineered nanoclusters in three dimensions. Such structures, with the current wide range of material choices, have great potential for advanced applications, including biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, nanomechanics, and nanophotonics.'
