excerpt: 'In this article, we show that the suppression of close-packed clustering and endocytosis can be achieved by the surface modification of the nanoparticles into Janus particles where a moiety of their surface is grafted with polymers under a good solvent condition. The osmotic pressure of the polymer brushes prevents membrane wrapping of the nanoparticles’ moieties that are grafted with polymers, thus suppressing their endocytosis.'
