excerpt: 'In this article, we show, through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, that spherical NPs with uniform surfaces adhering to the inner leaflet of lipid vesicles experience repulsive interactions, resulting in NP configurations in which they are apart. Systematic simulation sets with respect to the number of NPs inside vesicles and the strength of their adhesion to the membrane show an interesting phase diagram with different adhesion modes.'
