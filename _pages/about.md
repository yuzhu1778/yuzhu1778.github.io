I am a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University in the Borch Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. I am also affiliated with the Eli Lilly and Company–Purdue University Research Alliance Center as a member of the Nanomedicine Engineering Group, where my work focuses on studying structure–activity relationships.

My research interests lie in applying physics-based modeling and machine learning methods to solve real-world problems, particularly in computationally aided drug design. My current research focuses on developing advanced multi-scale computational workflows for simulating large biomolecular assemblies, including adeno-associated viruses (AAV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). By integrating physics-based approaches with machine learning techniques, my projects include the development of mapping and backmapping methods, molecular dynamics simulation engines, and structural analysis tools across multiple resolutions, ranging from coarse-grained to all-atom models.

During my Ph.D. training, I gained extensive experience in developing molecular dynamics engines and structural analysis pipelines for biomolecular systems, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymers. I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence. As part of this training, I completed several machine-learning–focused projects, inccluding the development of an AI agent that combines a domain-specific language with random decision trees to address the ARC-AGI tasks, a question-answering system based on key–value memory networks for document understanding and information retrieval, and a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing stock trading strategies.
